# Microsoft Azure Media and Entertainment

In a world still reeling from the effects of a global pandemic, demand for visual media and other forms of entertainment continues to rise. Film studios, production companies, TV channels, and streaming services need to get their productions to their audiences within fixed timescales and shrinking budgets.

Modern audiences expect more spectacular and realistic visual effects with each release. In consequence, visual effects teams need more computing power with every passing year. Simultaneously, editors demand greater control over textures and color grading, while producers need to minimize costs, yet meet fixed deadlines.

With post-production processing accounting for up to 30% of a film's eventual budget, studios and production companies are increasingly turning away from on-premises computing power. Racks of servers in render farms represent a significant capital investment that smaller, independent production companies cannot afford and even larger studios may not have the throughput to ensure that these resources are fully utilized. Microsoft Azure Media and Entertainment technologies provide scalable, cloud-based post-production processing facilities that enable you to spin up the resources you need to deliver your project on time and on budget.
