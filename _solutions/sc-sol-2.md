description: "Live Video Analytics on IoT Edge is a new capability of Azure Media Services. Live Video Analytics (LVA) provides a platform for you to build intelligent video applications that span the Edge and the Cloud. The platform offers the capability to capture, record, analyze live video and publish the results (video and/or video analytics) to Azure services (in the Cloud and/or the Edge). The platform can be used to enhance IoT solutions with video analytics. This folder contains Jupyter notebook samples for LVA. With Jupyter, you can create and deploy LVA applications on notebooks that contain live code, equations, and formatted text."
