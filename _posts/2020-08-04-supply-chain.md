>Are you looking to add advanced analytic capabilities to media assets?

>Are you looking to enrich data through downstream processing?

Media Supply Chain solutions focus on advanced processing capabilities on normalized assets prior to finalizing assets.
* Identify advanced analytic patterns in your datasets
* Post ingest processing of assets leading towards final product
* Enrich media assets for use in a common data service

<div class ="textbox">
Serverless automated metadata extraction pipeline from video files leveraging Azure Video Indexer. This service utilizes Azure Functions, Blob Storage and Azure Video Indexer to extract insights from a media asset that can be used to create promotions and trailers for media asset. For example: <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/Bw0C6kgnJo6/">Gotham Fox Promo</a>

Live Video Analytics on IoT Edge is a new capability of Azure Media Services. Live Video Analytics (LVA) provides a platform for you to build intelligent video applications that span the Edge and the Cloud. The platform offers the capability to capture, record, analyze live video and publish the results (video and/or video analytics) to Azure services (in the Cloud and/or the Edge). The platform can be used to enhance IoT solutions with video analytics. This folder contains Jupyter notebook samples for LVA. With Jupyter, you can create and deploy LVA applications on notebooks that contain live code, equations, and formatted text.
